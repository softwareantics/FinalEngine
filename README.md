## üîë Key Features

### üñ•Ô∏è Platform Support

While currently Windows-only, the architecture is intentionally modular and extensible. Key systems (such as rendering, input, and resource management) follow interface-driven design, allowing cross-platform implementations to be added over time.

### üé® Rendering Engine

Final Engine currently uses a minimal GDI+ software renderer to prioritize accessibility and simplicity. Through interface segregation, the rendering backend is **designed to be extensible**, paving the way for future support for APIs like OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX without disrupting existing code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Entity-Component-System (ECS) Architecture

Final Engine is built on the ECS paradigm, promoting a clean separation of concerns and a flexible game structure. This pattern enables high-performance systems and easily testable game logic.

> Learn more about ECS [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system).

### üì¶ Effortless Resource Management

Includes a lightweight and intuitive `IResourceManager` system, with plug-and-play support via `ResourceLoaderBase`. It‚Äôs easy to register and manage new asset types like textures, audio, and more.

### üõ†Ô∏è Desktop Editor *(Work in Progress)*

We're actively developing a desktop editor to streamline game development. This visual tool will help users manage scenes, entities, systems, and resources. A preview build is expected by the end of 2025.
